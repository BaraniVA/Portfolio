# Building ZeroInput: Creating an AI Productivity Assistant That Learns From You

When I started the ZeroInput project, I had a simple but ambitious goal:  
**Build a productivity assistant that learns from your behavior and suggests actions—without you needing to ask.**  
Today, ZeroInput is a fully working system, and I want to share the technical journey, challenges, and lessons I learned while bringing it to life.

## The Spark Behind ZeroInput

Like many developers, I noticed a pattern in my daily workflow:  
after coding in VS Code, I'd almost always open YouTube; after editing documents, I'd check emails.  
It got me thinking — what if a system could **recognize my habits and anticipate my next move?**

ZeroInput was born from that idea:  
an AI assistant that **monitors your context and intelligently suggests actions**, with the core philosophy of *zero manual input*.

## How ZeroInput Works: The Technical Architecture

Bringing this vision to life required weaving together multiple systems:

### 1. Context Awareness  
A custom `context_tracker.py` constantly monitors:
- Active window titles
- Recently accessed files
- Running processes

This allows ZeroInput to know *what* I'm working on at any given moment.

### 2. Memory System  
Built with `memory_store.py` and `memory_utils.py`, this layer:
- Stores observations in JSON
- Loads and cleans memory files
- Analyzes historical behavior patterns

### 3. Intelligence Layer  
The brain of ZeroInput uses multiple approaches:
- **Pattern Recognition** (`pattern_analyzer.py`): Finds repeating behavior
- **Inference Engine** (`inference_engine.py`): Deduces logical next steps
- **Machine Learning** (`ml_predictor.py`): Predicts actions with a TensorFlow LSTM model
- **Local LLM Queries**: Integrates a Phi model through Ollama for natural language-based suggestions

### 4. Execution System  
Through `action_executor.py` and `hotkey_manager.py`, ZeroInput can:
- Interpret and trigger smart actions
- Execute them quickly with a custom hotkey (Alt + Y)

### 5. Lightweight UI  
Minimalist by design:
- System tray integration (via `pystray`)
- Desktop notifications
- Configurable feedback for user actions

## Key Technical Challenges and Breakthroughs

### 🛠 Background Processes and Daemon Threads
Building a seamless background app taught me the importance of **reliable threading** and **graceful error handling**:

```python
def initialize_tray():
    """Initialize the system tray icon in a separate thread"""
    tray = ZeroInputTray()
    tray_thread = threading.Thread(target=tray.run, daemon=True)
    tray_thread.start()
    return tray
```

Running clean background services is harder than it sounds — and critical for user trust.

---

### 🧠 Machine Learning for Habit Prediction
Applying ML to predict user behavior was a real learning experience:

```python
def predict_next_app(recent_windows):
    """Predict the next app based on recent activity."""
    # TensorFlow LSTM model implementation
```

Key steps included:
- Preparing sequential app usage data
- Architecting an LSTM to model temporal patterns
- Handling "cold starts" gracefully for new users

Watching the model gradually "get smarter" over time was incredibly rewarding.

---

### 🤖 Local LLM Integration
Adding local LLMs (Large Language Models) unlocked natural language suggestions:

```python
def ask_phi(prompt):
    """Query Phi model via Ollama."""
    result = subprocess.run(['ollama', 'run', 'phi'], input=prompt.encode(), timeout=30)
```

Challenges I tackled:
- Managing timeouts and fallbacks
- Designing better prompts for faster, clearer answers
- Keeping everything **on-device** for privacy and speed

---

### 🔁 Building a Feedback Loop
One powerful feature was the **self-improving feedback loop**:

```python
def record_suggestion_feedback(current_window):
    """Log if the user followed the suggestion."""
```

If ZeroInput noticed I ignored a suggestion consistently, it learned to stop recommending it.  
Real-world usage helped sharpen its usefulness over time.

## Lessons Learned

Beyond technical skills, this project taught me much bigger lessons:

- **Start simple, then iterate fast.**  
  My MVP just tracked window titles. Complexity came later.

- **Prioritize resilience.**  
  In background apps, *graceful failure* is critical. No crash = trust.

- **Good UX is invisible.**  
  Even when the tool is minimal, the small moments (notifications, feedback) matter.

- **Logs are lifesavers.**  
  Debugging asynchronous, long-running processes without logs? Impossible.

- **Real-world testing beats theoretical testing.**  
  Some bugs and UX insights only surfaced after days of actual use.

- **Multiple strategies > One model.**  
  Pattern-based suggestions, ML predictions, and LLM insights complemented each other beautifully.

## What's Next for ZeroInput?

I'm actively working on:
- Smarter multi-action sequences
- Deepened ML models (time-aware attention mechanisms)
- Web service integrations (calendars, emails)
- Customizable suggestion engines
- More resilient long-term memory management

## Final Thoughts

ZeroInput is more than just another side project — it's a tool that genuinely **makes my day more productive**.  
Each time it correctly predicts what I need before I even realize it, it feels like a small personal victory.

Building something that you actually use every day is the ultimate reward — and I'm excited to keep evolving ZeroInput even further.

If you're curious, the project is live on [my GitHub](https://github.com/BaraniVA) — feedback, suggestions, and collaborations are welcome!
